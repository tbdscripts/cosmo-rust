# Rust Integration
Using this Rust plugin allows you to automate your Cosmo store with Rust.

## Setting up
1. Download this repository as a ZIP file.
    - Click on the green "Code" button on the top right.
    - Click "Download ZIP"
2. Place the `Cosmo.cs` file (found in the ZIP you just downloaded) inside the Oxide plugins folder
3. Restart your server and configure the config (found in the Oxide config folder).
4. Restart your server again, and now the integration is ready to be used.

## Notes
This plugin will soon be rewritten. The direct database integration will be replaced with an abstraction layer provided by your Cosmo instance's API endpoints.
